# 452_final
Final Project for LIS 452

This Python program attempts to create a generalized method for splitting discrete, predefined chapters
or sections from Project Gutenberg e-books. It uses five of the most popular downloads as test cases,
and the user can specify which of the five they would like to test when running the program.

When the program prompts you, pick one of the titles from the displayed list and type it. Exact spelling
matters, but capitalization does not.

At that point the program will run, creating a new directory with the title of the e-book and writing
each individual chapter or section as a new .txt file.

The program will then calculate the number of words in each chapter as well as the average number of
words per chapter in the entire book, and it will determine which 10 words (other than commonly used
stop words) are used the most throughout the text.
